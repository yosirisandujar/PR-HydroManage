//WATER RESERVOIRS DAILY DATA FUNCTION
//This script correspond to the functionality of retrieving data for water reservoirs from the USGS database.
// Sata has to collect the data from the day before in a single get for a single site

//In order to make the least amount of resquests possible.


//This are the libraries this function uses, "request" and "cheerio" are libraries used for the extraction of data from the USGS database thourgh the links generated below.
//Node schedule is used to schedule the time in which the function is allowed to run, it uses cron tab functionality with simplified syntaxis.
//Util is a script made with utility functions, one used to get the date from the day before and the other reads a json and gets the values of the keys specified in the parameter.
